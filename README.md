# Fake News Detection
## Introduction
With the increasing volume of online news, detecting fake news has become a significant challenge. This project provides a system to classify news articles as fake or real using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning algorithms. The goal of this project is to help prevent the spread of misinformation and enhance trust in online news.

# Features
- Text preprocessing (removing noise, normalization, and tokenization)
- Feature extraction using:
  - TF-IDF
  - Word Embeddings
- Machine learning models used for classification:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Model evaluation with metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
- Dataset
This project uses a public dataset containing examples of fake and real news articles. The dataset includes the following columns:

- Text: The content of the news article
- Label: The category of the article (fake or real)
- The dataset can be accessed at Dataset Li
